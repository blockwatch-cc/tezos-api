# Time-Series Endpoints {#time-series-endpoints}

>  **Generic Time-Series Query**

```
https://api.tzstats.com/series/{table_code}.{format}?{args}
```

The time-series API is an abstraction over tables which allows for server-side aggregation of multiple result rows over time. Time-series are meant to be displayed as graphs with time on the x-axis and some aggregate value on the y-axis. Since the underlying data is still in tabular form all table filters work on time-series as well.

Note that this time-series API does not fill gaps. That means when the underlying table contains no data for a particular time interval, the corresponding time-series row will be missing. Clients should be prepared for this case and fill gaps if required.

Intervals between timestamps are equally spaced and can be controlled by the `collapse` query parameter, i.e. `1d` means each interval contains 24 hours of aggregated data. Time-series data can contain fields of all supported numeric data types (e.g. no strings or binary data). The aggregation function is fixed by the semantics of the data type. This may either be a sum, a count, first, last, min, max or mean value.

On the free API tier historic access is restricted to 90 days.

### List of supported time-series

Endpoint | Time-Series Content
---------|-----------------------
`GET /series/block`                     | aggregated block data
`GET /series/flow`                      | aggregated balances, freezer and delegation flows
`GET /series/op`                        | aggregated operations data
`GET /series/chain`                     | running total counters for on-chain operations, accounts and rolls
`GET /series/supply`                    | running supply totals
`GET /series/{exchange}/{market}/ohlcv` | OHLCV candles

## Query Arguments

Time-series datasets support the following query parameters.

Argument | Description
----------|-----------------
`columns` *optional*   | Comma separated list of columns you like to fetch. Bulk array results will be ordered accordingly. Default is all defined columns for a series.
`collapse` *optional*  | Aggregate numeric data over different sampling intervals. Supported values are `1m` (default), `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `3h`, `4h`, `6h`, `12h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1M`, `3M`and `1y`.
`order` *optional*    | Return data in `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending) order. Default is `asc`.
`limit` *optional*    | Maximum number of aggregated results returned. Limited to 50,000, default 500.
`start_date` *optional* | Start of the time range to query. See [timestamps](#json-data-types) for syntax.
`end_date` *optional* | End of the time range to query. See [timestamps](#json-data-types) for syntax.

When only start or end date are provided, the other end of the range is deducted from collapse and limit. I.e. with collapse of `1d` and limit of `30` you'll get 30 days of data after start_date or before end_date. Called without any optional parameters a query defaults to the most recent 500 minutes (`end_date=now`, `limit=500` and `collapse=1m`).


## Query Filters

Time-series support the same filters [used on tables](#query-filters) with the same filter expressions of form `<column>.<operator>=<arg>`. Filters can be used on all table fields, including fields that are not part of the aggregated result such as addresses and type enums.

## Flow Series

> **Example request (network-wide re-delegation flows).**

```shell
curl "https://api.tzstats.com/series/flow?start_date=today&collapse=1d&category=delegation"
```

> **Example response.**

```json
[
  [
    1570060800000, // time
    200650.535155, // amount_in
    246036.709877  // amount_out
    12,            // count
  ]
]
```

Lists aggregate data about flows. Filters are the same as on the [flow table](#flow-table), but response fields are limited to numeric data that can be aggregated over time. Aggregation function for all fields is **sum**.

An interesting feature of flow series is that you can reconstruct the entire balance and delegation history of an account. You can either start at account creation time assuming zero balances or start at the current account state and work your way backwards through flows.
